- Support for server/peripheral role on iOS and partially Android.
- Background mode support controlled by other plugins.
- Require Cordova 5+
- Descriptor now includes permissions when discovering on Android...although descriptors never seem to have permissions set.
- Fixed bug with descriptor values being typed wrong. Now value can have a type of data, number or string.
- Fixed bug with write descriptor callback never being returned.
- Fixed bug which allowed Client Configuration Descriptor to be written, which throws an iOS error.
- Normalized write without response behavior. iOS now returns a write success immediately after executing the write.
- Callbacks for discover, services, characteristics, descriptors, rssi, mtu, readDescriptor, writeDescriptor. Basically everything now.
- Some code cleanup

## 3.3.0 - 2016-03-23
- Added requestLocation function to help enable location on Android 6.0. Location services must be enabled to scan for unpaired devices. [\#238](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/238)
- Updated readme with walkthrough example - Thanks [normesta](https://github.com/normesta)

## 3.2.0 - 2016-03-21
- Added writeQ function for faster writes.
- Updated config.xml to support Windows 10 [\#242](https://github.com/randdusing/cordova-plugin-bluetoothle/pull/242) - Thanks [TimBarham](https://github.com/TimBarham)

## 3.1.0 - 2016-02-23
- Fixed issue with requestPermission() causing crash when executed on Android versions prior to 6.0.
- Added ability to check whether location services are enabled or not. Android 6.0 requires location services to be enabled to find unpaired devices.
- Windows API now compliant with v3.

## 3.0.1 - 2016-01-26
- Fixed issue with API21+ code running on earlier API versions and causing the plugin to crash.

## 3.0.0 - 2016-01-25
- Removed connecting / disconnecting statuses since they didn't provide much value and complicated the callback logic.
- Shortened serviceUuid, characteristicUuid, descriptorUuid to uuid or service/characteristic/descriptor depending on the context. See the readme for more info.
- Removed error callback from initialize. The success callback will be used to provide enabled or disabled status updates. [\#227](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/227)
- Read/Write/Subscribe/Unsubscribe now return the error callback on unexpected disconnects. For example, iOS 9 wouldn't automatically call the error callback for a read operation when unexpectedly disconnected. On iOS 8 and Android, it would. Future versions will add this to other operations like rssi, readDescriptor, writeDescriptor, etc.
- More advertisement data provided on iOS. [\#110](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/110)
- Support for new and improved Android scanning. [\#232](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/232) Thanks [pscholl](https://github.com/pscholl)
- Fixed bug with scan race condition [\#223](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/223)
- Fixed bug where unsubscribe wouldn't throw an error when already unsubscribed and subscribe wouldn't throw an error when already subscribed.
- Fixed bug where error callback was used instead of success callback when the device unexpectedly disconnected. [\#209](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/209)
- Fixed bug where non-BLE devices were returned with retrieveConnected on Android
- Added permissions information to Android discovery.
- Updated and simplified Angular wrapper. Timeouts can now specified for almost any type of operation. Improved its example.
- Removed example. Use the Angular wrapper's example instead. Keeping both examples up to date was too time consuming.
- Changed license to MIT.

## 2.7.1 - 2016-01-12
### Changes
- Forgot to increment version

## 2.7.0 - 2015-12-30
### Changes
- Close can now be called if the device isn't already disconnected.

## 2.6.0 - 2015-12-30
### Changes
- Instead of automatically requesting permissions on scan. It can now be done via the hasPermission and requestPermission functions available for Android. This only needs to be done on Android 6.0 / SDK 23.

## 2.5.0 - 2015-11-10
### Fixed
- Scan now works on Android 6.0, but requires ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission. The permission will be requested when startScan is called. If the permission isn't granted, an error of "permissions" will be returned. [\#204](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/204)

### Documentation
- Added information about permissions and targetting SDK 23

## 2.4.0 - 2015-10-20
### Added
- iOS supports Android style discovery [\#63](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/63)

## 2.3.0 - 2015-09-27
### Other
- Added support for NPM

## 2.2.0 - 2015-09-27

- Retrieve connected support for Android. Some older Android versions / older devices wouldn't include paired devices in a scan. Doesn't support UUID filtering like iOS

### Changes
- Android projects should target API 21 [\#134](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/134) [\#136](https://github.com/randdusing/BluetoothLE/issues/136)

### Fixed
